# **Pathfinding in Pakistan Cities**

## **Introduction**
This project implements a graph visualization for the cities of Pakistan, where different pathfinding algorithms—BFS, DFS, and UCS—are used to find the shortest path between cities. The cities are represented as nodes in a graph, and the connections (edges) between them represent travel routes with associated costs. This report provides an overview of the implementation, the algorithms, and the dynamic features included in the code.

## **Purpose**
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how pathfinding algorithms can be applied to a graph of cities and visualize the results dynamically. The project provides users with a way to input cities, select algorithms, and visualize the pathfinding process. Additionally, users can add new cities to the graph and connect them to existing cities with specified costs, making the graph more dynamic and adaptable.

## **Graph Representation**
The cities are represented as nodes in a graph, where each node corresponds to a specific city in Pakistan. The connections between the cities are represented as weighted edges, with the weights representing the cost (or distance) between the cities. The graph structure is stored as an adjacency list, where each city (node) points to a set of neighboring cities along with the corresponding costs. Initially, the graph contains a set of predefined cities, but users have the option to add new cities and define their connections dynamically.

## **Visualization**
The graph is visualized using HTML and CSS, with each city displayed as a circle (node) on a grid layout. The nodes are placed at random positions within the graph container, and the connections (edges) are represented as lines between the cities. The edges are drawn dynamically based on the relationships between the cities, and the cost of each connection is displayed as a label on the corresponding edge. The graph updates in real-time as cities are added and connected.

## **Dynamic Features**
- **Adding a New City:** The system allows the user to add new cities to the graph. Each new city is connected to an existing city selected by the user, with a cost for the connection provided by the user. The new city is placed at a random position in the graph, and the graph layout is updated to reflect the changes.
- **Dynamic Algorithm Selection:** The user can select between BFS, DFS, and UCS algorithms to find a path between two cities. The results of the selected algorithm are dynamically displayed, showing the path from the start city to the end city. For UCS, the total cost of the path is also calculated and displayed.
- **City Connection Interface:** The user can select any existing city to connect to a new city. This functionality ensures that new cities are connected to cities that already exist in the graph, maintaining the integrity of the graph structure.

## **Languages and Tools Used**
- **HTML:** Used to structure the content of the webpage and create forms for user input.
- **CSS:** Used to style the graph visualization and user interface elements such as buttons, dropdowns, and inputs.
- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used to implement the pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS), manage the graph structure, handle dynamic features like adding new cities, and update the visualization.
- **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is used to dynamically manipulate the DOM to visualize the graph, add new nodes, and update the connections.

## **Functions in the Code**
The code contains several key functions that handle the various operations:
- **`visualizeGraph()`**: This function draws the cities and edges on the screen based on the current graph structure. It dynamically updates the graph when new cities are added.
- **`createEdge()`**: This function creates and positions an edge between two cities in the graph.
- **`addNewCity()`**: This function handles the process of adding a new city to the graph, selecting an existing city to connect to, and specifying the cost for the connection.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS):** These functions implement the respective pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest path between a start city and an end city. The UCS algorithm also calculates the total cost of the path.

## **Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates how pathfinding algorithms can be applied to a graph of cities and how the results can be visualized in a dynamic and interactive manner. The ability to add new cities and define their connections to existing cities enhances the flexibility of the system. The code provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to experiment with different cities and pathfinding algorithms, offering insights into the behavior of each algorithm in a graph-based system. The project is a good foundation for exploring more complex graph algorithms and can be extended with additional features like real-time graph updates, advanced pathfinding techniques, and enhanced user interaction.
